# Slice Backlog Helper

If the user didn't provide Acceptance Criteria:
1) Open `docs/Slice-Backlog.md` (if present).
2) Choose the first `[ ] TODO` slice that contains a ready block (AC + Plan).
3) Propose that slice back to the user. If approved, proceed with tests-first and the plan.
4) After completion, remind the user to mark it `[x] DONE` in `docs/Slice-Backlog.md`.
